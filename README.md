# heat-exchanger-design-tool

## About 
This is a Matlab tool to aid in the design of shell & tube heat exchangers, with built-in optimization functionality. 
  
It uses a genetic algorithm to find the heat exchanger dimensions that minimize the annual cost, while meeting the required heat transfer rate.

Currently it solves for the following variables:
```
- tube length 
- shell diameter
- tube diameter
- number of passes
- number of tubes
- baffle spacing
```
